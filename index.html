    <h2>What is Sonic Happy Hour?</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re someone who enjoys grabbing a quick drink or snack without spending too much, then the Sonic Happy Hour is made for you. 
      During this special time, you can enjoy half-price drinks, refreshing slushes, and other favorites from the Sonic menu. Whether you’re stopping by for a cold drink on a hot day or want to treat yourself after work, this offer lets you save money while enjoying the same great taste Sonic is known for.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes it even better is how simple it is — you just pull up, place your order, and enjoy your favorites for less. The Sonic Happy Hour menu changes from time to time, with new flavors and limited-time deals that keep things exciting. Before heading out, check your local Sonic or the app to see what’s available near you, so you never miss a good deal.

    <h2>Sonic Happy Hour Time</h2>
    <p>
      Sonic Happy Hour is your go-to time for big drink savings on the Sonic menu. It’s a short daily window when many drinks and slushes drop to about half price, so you can grab a refreshing treat without paying full price. The promotion usually shows up in the afternoon and sometimes again late at night — but exact hours can vary by location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond half-price sips, Sonic often runs app deals and limited-time snack promos that run alongside Happy Hour (think $1 snacky items or seasonal slush floats). That means you can score extra value if you order through the Sonic app or check for local offers first. Always check your local Sonic or the app so you know what’s on the Sonic Happy Hour menu near you.
    </p>

    <h3>Regular Happy Hour Time</h3>
    <p>
      Most Sonic locations run their Happy Hour from 2 PM to 4 PM, giving you a solid window to grab your go-to drink. Some spots even offer late-night Happy Hours for those evening cravings. Before you head out, check your local Sonic or the Sonic app — times and deals can change depending on where you are. Either way, it’s the sweetest time to sip and save.
    </p>

    <h3>Sonic’s Late-Night Happy Hour</h3>
    <p>

The Sonic Happy Hour menu keeps the fun going late into the night, usually starting around 8 PM and lasting until closing time. It’s your chance to grab half-price slushes, shakes, and a few tasty snacks without spending much.
